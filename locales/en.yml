  Welcome to Inforno! Your private vehicle for exploring the AI Models World!\n
  \n
  Inforno is a graphical user interface frontend for Ollama and OpenRouter.
  It does not run any Large Language Models (LLMs), bur rather
  redirects the prompt entered by user to one or more Agents, which are
  provided by one or both of the backend solutions: Ollama and OpenRouter.\n
  \n
  Ollama is a background service that runs on your computer
  that enables you to run LLM's on your
  for free, as long as the model is available for download and your
  computer has enough memory do run that model. For a list of models readily
  supported by Ollama, go to ollama.com/search\n
  \n
  OpenRouter is a commercial cloud solution that routes user prompts to other
  cloud providers, giving you access to big commercial LLM's like Claude Opus,
  without any monthly/yearly subscriptions. You just put the
  money on your OpenRouter account, and it is deducted on a per-token basis. The
  prices for different models range widely, but they are stated on their website
  and you can sompare and shop around before deciding which model(s) to talk to.
  \n\n
  Disclaimer: we, the creators of Inforno are not affiliated to Ollama or
  OpenRouter. Inforno just uses those services on your behalf. We do not collect
  any of your personal information. Your OpenRouter key is never sent to us,
  it stays on the computer you are using. We will never ask you the key. If
  someone asks you your API key or money - it's a scam! We don't
  charge any money, we don't have any subscriptions, customer account page or
  a database server that stores any of your information.
  \n\n
  Also, keep in mind that even OpenRouter itself does not run LLM's, but rather
  passes your query to 3rd party providers which can be monitored by all sorts
  of authorities, hackers or corporate environments with weak security measures,
  where employees might have access to the data. You are on your own there,
  so be careful what you ask when using OpenRouter. If you are not sure, or if
  your prompt contains private or sensitive information - stick strictly to
  Ollama for such requests. And remember in any case: LLM's are not the source
  of truth. Check responses and always use your own judgement!
  \n\n
  If you open the Presets window and click the New Preset button, you will see
  the Select a Router radio buttons: Ollama or Openrouter. If you select Ollama,
  make sure that Ollama is running on your computer. You can then
  start typing ino the Select a Model tab and the autocomplete will suggest the
  models that can be downloaded by Ollama directly by preseing Download Model
  button. Ollama also supports custom user-made models in gguf format, but you
  would need to manually install those.
  \n\n
  To start using OpenRouter, you don't need a powerful computer or download any
  models. All you need is an internet connection and the OpenRouter API Key.
  You can get one for free by just signing up on their page openrouter.ai and
  pressing the Get API Key button. If it's not on their front page, just click
  the round Account button on top right, and select Key. Api Keys window will
  have the list of your API keys that are basically the authentication tokens
  that are needed to use OpenRouter service from a third-party application. You
  can also go into Chat pane and try their online interface, which has similar
  functionality to what Inforno does. One advantage of Inforno, is that it
  stores the chat history in a local Sandbox file that can be saved as a copy,
  opened later and shared wih other Inforno users.
  \n\n
  Once API Key is created you can press API Keys button and copy/paste the key
  into the API Key Manager window. You will have an option to save it to the
  System Keyring or just use it until you exit the application (if this is not
  your computer, for example).
  \n\n
  You can now enter your prompts in the Chat pane, select presets to send the
  prompts to and press the Send Prommpt button. All the replies are
  automatically saved in a local file. The Sandbox menu allows you to save The
  chat history file. Save As... means it will be moved from the default app data
  directory which is ~./local/shared/inforno/info.rno in Linux or
  C:/users/user/appdata/roaming/inforno/info.rno in Windows to a specified
  location. It can then be opened next time you use Inforno by using the Open
  button. The Save A Copy... button allows you to save the Sandbox ot a specified
  file, but stay in the default sandbox. You can also clear the Sandbox if
  you want.
  \n\n
  The Prompt editor in the bottom allows you to add a System prompt. There is a
  small 💻 button, clicking which opens the text editor just for that purpose.
